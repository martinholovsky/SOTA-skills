# SOTA Web Frameworks (2026)

## Purpose

This skill encodes the 2026 state of the art for the two dominant JavaScript SSR
stacks — **React + Next.js** and **Vue + Nuxt** — and the server-rendering concerns
they share. It is deliberately framework-specific: the traps that matter here
(the RSC server/client boundary, Server Actions as public endpoints, hydration
mismatches, SSR state leaking across requests, `runtimeConfig`/`NEXT_PUBLIC_`
secret boundaries) do not exist at the plain-language level.

Two modes:

- **BUILD** — writing or modifying components, routes, and data-fetching to this standard.
- **AUDIT** — reviewing an existing app and reporting findings.

Read SKILL.md fully; load `rules/*.md` on demand per the index below. **Verify every
version/CVE claim at use time** — this file's facts were primary-sourced 2026-07 but
framework security moves weekly (see the 2025-12 React Server Components RCE).

## Scope boundaries (what lives elsewhere)

This skill stacks *on top of* the general skills — load them together, don't duplicate:

- **`sota-javascript-typescript`** — strict `tsconfig`, type design, promises,
  Node hardening, npm supply chain. The *language*; this skill is the *framework*.
- **`sota-frontend-design`** — visual design, layout, components-as-UX, WCAG 2.2
  accessibility, motion. This skill covers component *engineering*, not *design*.
- **`sota-code-security`** — generic XSS/CSRF/SSRF/authn/authz/crypto theory. This
  skill covers the *framework-specific* expression of those (RSC data exposure,
  Server Action authz, `v-html`, next/image SSRF).
- **`sota-performance`** rules/06 — Core Web Vitals, bundle budgets, image/font
  loading. This skill covers render-strategy choice (SSR/SSG/ISR/PPR) and hydration.
- **`sota-api-design`** — REST/GraphQL contract design for the routes themselves.

## BUILD mode

1. **Establish context first.** Read `package.json` for the exact React/Next or
   Vue/Nuxt majors and the render mode in use (App vs Pages Router; Nuxt SSR vs
   `ssr: false`). Match the project's baseline — no Server Actions on a Pages-Router
   app, no `defineModel` below Vue 3.4. Confirm the versions are supported and
   patched against the CVE tables in `rules/03`/`rules/05`. (`rules/01`)
2. **Default to the current idiom:** React function components + hooks (let the React
   Compiler memoize — don't hand-write `useMemo` everywhere); Vue Composition API with
   `<script setup>`. Server Components by default in Next App Router, `"use client"`
   only at the leaves that need interactivity. (`rules/02`, `rules/04`)
3. **The server/client boundary is a security boundary, not just a perf one.** Every
   prop crossing server→client is serialized into the HTML/RSC payload and is public.
   Authorization lives *next to the data* (a Data Access Layer / validated server
   route), never only in middleware or a layout. (`rules/03`, `rules/07`)
4. **Treat every Server Action and Nitro route as a public, unauthenticated HTTP
   endpoint** until it validates input and checks authz itself — even if it looks
   internal or is never imported. (`rules/03`, `rules/05`, `rules/07`)
5. **Get hydration right by construction:** deterministic render (no `Date.now()`,
   `Math.random()`, or `window` in render), stable IDs via `useId`, SSR-safe shared
   state (`useState`/per-request instances, never module-level refs). (`rules/06`)
6. **Serialize SSR state safely** (framework serializer or escaped JSON, never naked
   `JSON.stringify` into `<script>`) and **wire CSP** (nonce or hash) knowing it forces
   dynamic rendering in Next. (`rules/06`, `rules/07`)
7. **Tests accompany code** (`sota-testing`): component tests plus at least one test
   that exercises the server/client boundary or a server route's authz.

## AUDIT mode

1. **Fingerprint + patch-check first.** Pin exact framework/loader versions from the
   lockfile and diff them against the CVE tables in `rules/03` and `rules/05`. An
   unpatched React2Shell (CVE-2025-55182) or middleware bypass (CVE-2025-29927) is
   CRITICAL on its own, before any code is read.
2. **Trace the trust boundary.** Grep `"use client"`/`"use server"`, `defineProps`,
   `runtimeConfig`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_`/`NUXT_PUBLIC_`; find where server data crosses to
   the client and where authz is enforced. Middleware/layout-only authz is a finding.
3. **Run each relevant rules file's Audit checklist** (grep-driven), then read for
   design: hydration determinism, SSR state isolation, caching of personalized pages.
4. **Verify every finding** — a `v-html` fed a constant is not XSS; a Server Action
   that re-checks the session is not IDOR. Note mitigations already present.

### Severity conventions

| Severity | Meaning | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| CRITICAL | Exploitable now / RCE / data loss | Unpatched RSC deserialization RCE; middleware-bypass auth on the only authz layer; secret in `NEXT_PUBLIC_`/`public` runtimeConfig; `unserialize`-class sink |
| HIGH | Exploitable with preconditions | Server Action / Nitro route with no authz (IDOR); SSRF via next/image `**` or user-URL fetch; `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`/`v-html` of user data; whole-DB-row as a client prop |
| MEDIUM | Real but bounded, or reliability | Personalized SSR page cacheable at a shared CDN; hydration mismatch on user data; missing CSP; module-level SSR state; unpatched non-critical CVE |
| LOW | Deviation from SOTA | Pages Router for greenfield; hand-rolled memoization vs React Compiler; `$fetch` double-fetch in setup; Options API for a new app |
| INFO | Worth knowing | Newer render mode available; migration opportunities |

### Finding format

```
file:line | rule violated (rules/NN §S) | severity | effort | fix
```

Effort: trivial · small · medium · large. Group by severity, CRITICAL first.
Borderline severities state the deciding assumption; unconfirmed findings are
marked "needs verification", never asserted. End with per-severity counts, the
sweep commands run, and explicit "checked and clean" areas.

## Rules index

| File | Read this when... |
|---|---|
| `rules/01-baseline.md` | choosing or verifying a stack and version floor (React/Next/Vue/Nuxt support+EOL matrix), picking a render mode (CSR/SSR/SSG/ISR/PPR), project setup, React Compiler |
| `rules/02-react.md` | writing React components: hooks rules, `useId`/`useEffect`/refs, Suspense & error boundaries, `use()`/Actions/`useActionState`, memoization & the React Compiler, `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` |
| `rules/03-nextjs.md` | Next.js App Router: Server vs Client Components, Server Actions, the caching model (`use cache`/Cache Components/PPR/ISR/`revalidate`), `proxy.ts`/middleware, the Data Access Layer, and Next CVEs |
| `rules/04-vue.md` | writing Vue: Composition API & `<script setup>`, reactivity pitfalls (props destructure, `shallowRef`, watchers, `effectScope`), `defineModel`, TypeScript, and Vue XSS (`v-html`, template injection) |
| `rules/05-nuxt.md` | Nuxt 4: data fetching (`useFetch`/`useAsyncData`/`$fetch`), `useState`, `runtimeConfig`, Nitro server routes & auth, `routeRules`/hybrid rendering, islands, and Nuxt/Nitro/h3/IPX CVEs |
| `rules/06-ssr-hydration.md` | anything SSR: hydration mismatches & determinism, SSR state-serialization XSS, cross-request state pollution, caching personalized pages safely, CSP with streaming SSR |
| `rules/07-security.md` | a security pass: the server/client secret boundary, authorization placement (post-CVE-2025-29927), SSRF surfaces, the consolidated framework CVE reference, and supply-chain notes |

## Top-10 non-negotiables

1. **Run supported, patched majors.** React ≥ 19.x, Next ≥ 15.x (16.x current), Vue
   ≥ 3.5, Nuxt ≥ 4.x (Nuxt 3 security-only until 2026-07-31). Cross-check the CVE
   tables — an unpatched RSC RCE (CVE-2025-55182) or middleware bypass
   (CVE-2025-29927) is a ship-stopper. (`rules/01`, `rules/03`, `rules/05`)
2. **Authorization lives next to the data, never only in middleware or a layout.**
   `proxy.ts`/middleware is an optimization, not the auth layer; each Server Action,
   Route Handler, and Nitro route re-checks authn + authz. (`rules/03`, `rules/07`)
3. **Every prop that crosses server→client is public.** It's serialized into the RSC
   payload / HTML. Pass minimal DTOs, never raw DB rows, tokens, or `process.env`.
   (`rules/03`, `rules/07`)
4. **Server Components by default; `"use client"` only where interactivity requires
   it.** Keep secrets and data access in Server Components / server-only modules
   (`import 'server-only'`). (`rules/02`, `rules/03`)
5. **Secrets never reach the client bundle.** Nothing sensitive in `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`,
   `VITE_*`, or `runtimeConfig.public` — those are inlined at build time. (`rules/07`)
6. **Validate every server-route/action input with a schema** (`getValidatedBody`/Zod;
   never trust `formData`, `searchParams`, or headers), and check resource ownership
   to prevent IDOR. (`rules/03`, `rules/05`)
7. **Hydrate deterministically:** no `Date`/random/`window` in render, stable IDs via
   `useId`, SSR-safe shared state — and never "fix" a mismatch by injecting
   server-side user HTML. (`rules/06`)
8. **Serialize SSR state safely.** Framework serializer (devalue) or `<`-escaped JSON
   in `<script>`; naked `JSON.stringify` into a script tag is XSS. (`rules/06`)
9. **User HTML is dangerous HTML.** `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`/`v-html` only on
   sanitizer output; validate `href`/URL schemes (`javascript:`); lock `next/image`
   `remotePatterns` to explicit hosts (no `**`). (`rules/02`, `rules/04`, `rules/07`)
10. **Don't cache personalized SSR at a shared cache.** `Cache-Control: private` for
    per-user pages; know that CDNs drop `Vary`; wire CSP nonces knowing they force
    dynamic rendering. (`rules/06`)
