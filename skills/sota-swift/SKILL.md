# SOTA Swift (2026)

Expert-level rules for producing and auditing production Swift, on any target. Swift is a
language first and an Apple-platform toolkit second: a Vapor service on Linux, a CLI and an
iOS app share every rule here. **Platform concerns route elsewhere**: app lifecycle, store
review, Keychain, push and offline sync → `sota-mobile`; containers → `sota-sandboxing`;
telemetry → `sota-observability`.

**Version floor.** swift.org publishes **no end-of-life or support-window policy** for older
Swift releases (searched the swift.org site source, 2026-10-07); the nearest written bar is the
Swift Server Workgroup's graduation criteria — *"Support new GA versions of Swift within 30d"*
and a *"documented support strategy for at least one previous major version"*. So pin the
toolchain you build with, verify the latest release at swift.org, and treat the **language
mode** as the load-bearing line: Swift 6 mode makes data-race safety a compile error.
Feature notes below name the release that introduced each feature.

## BUILD mode

1. Declare the toolchain and language mode in `Package.swift` (`swift-tools-version: 6.x`,
   `swiftLanguageModes:` — `swiftLanguageVersions` is deprecated since 6.1, SE-0441) and pin the
   toolchain for CI (rules/08).
2. Read the rules files that match the work (index below). Concurrency (rules/03) applies to
   any code with `async`, actors or shared state; security (rules/05) to anything touching
   input, files, processes, SQL or the network; server code also reads rules/06.
3. Write value types, exhaustive enums and non-optional straight-line code (rules/01); keep the
   public surface small and evolvable (rules/02).
4. **Self-audit last**: walk each loaded file's Audit checklist against the diff, then the
   router's principle 5 (abuse control, transport, tests, logs) before presenting.

## AUDIT mode

1. Recon: `Package.swift` (tools version, language modes, `unsafeFlags`, plugins, macros,
   binary targets), `Package.resolved`, CI config, the server framework in use.
2. Run what is installed (never install unasked): the compiler in Swift 6 mode with
   `-warnings-as-errors`, SwiftLint, `swift build --sbom-spec` (6.4+), a dependency scanner
   (rules/09), CodeQL's Swift queries where CI has them.
3. Walk every applicable rules file's Audit checklist; each probe below is a grep you can run.
4. Report in the canonical format; severity per the table, chain closure per the `sota` router.

### Severity conventions (refines the router's `rules/03` §1 inside this skill)

| Severity | Swift examples |
|---|---|
| Critical | SQL built with `\(unsafeRaw:)` from request input; `certificateVerification: .none` on a production client; `/bin/sh -c` with interpolated input; `NSKeyedUnarchiver.unarchiveObject(with:)` on untrusted bytes |
| High | data race behind `nonisolated(unsafe)` / `@unchecked Sendable` on reachable state; unauthenticated route group missing its guard middleware; session cookies left at Vapor's `isSecure: false` default; debug build shipped (raw error text to clients); plugin/macro dependency unreviewed on a Linux CI that runs them unsandboxed |
| Medium | `try!`/`!`/`as!` on input-derived values; `Double` for money; unbounded `AsyncStream` buffer; `Task.detached` without reason; ReDoS-prone regex on input |
| Low | `try?` on a write path; `any P` on a hot path; missing `final`; IUO outside two-phase init |

### Finding format

`file:line | rule | severity | effort | fix` — the router's canonical row; expand each
surviving finding to the router's `rules/03` §2 evidence block.

## Top 10 non-negotiables

1. **Swift 6 language mode** for all first-party code; every `nonisolated(unsafe)`,
   `@unchecked Sendable`, `@preconcurrency` and `unowned(unsafe)` carries a comment naming the
   invariant that makes it safe.
2. **No `!`, `try!` or `as!` on values derived from input**; `guard let`/`throw` instead.
3. **Untyped `throws` on public APIs**; typed throws only inside a closed boundary.
4. **Structured concurrency first**; every unstructured `Task` has an owner that cancels it;
   long loops check cancellation.
5. **No retain cycles**: escaping closures stored by `self` capture `[weak self]`.
6. **SQL binds, never interpolates**: no `\(unsafeRaw:)`/`unsafeSQL:` with input; processes
   take an argument array, never `/bin/sh -c`.
7. **TLS verification stays on**; minimum TLS 1.2 set explicitly on NIOSSL clients.
8. **Ship release builds** (`swift build -c release`); production behaviour never depends on a
   debug build's `#if DEBUG` or Vapor's compile-time `isRelease`.
9. **Commit `Package.resolved` and resolve with `--force-resolved-versions` in CI**; review
   plugins and macros as build-time code — on Linux they run unsandboxed.
10. **Warnings are errors in CI**, and every SwiftLint/compiler suppression is visible and
    justified.

## Operating notes

- Swift moves fast; Swift Evolution proposal status (swift.org/swift-evolution) is the primary
  source for whether a feature has shipped. "Accepted" is not "implemented".
- Facts here carry their verification date; re-check before pinning a version or quoting a
  default.
