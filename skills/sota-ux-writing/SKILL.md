  State-of-the-art UX writing and product-copy guidance (2026) covering voice
  and tone systems, plain language (ISO 24495-1), microcopy (buttons, labels,
  empty states, onboarding, notifications), error and feedback message craft,
  and the accessibility and localization of interface language (WCAG 2.2
  language criteria, alt text, ICU pluralization, i18n-safe strings). Use when
  writing or reviewing ANY user-facing interface text — web, mobile, desktop,
  or CLI products — AND when auditing existing product copy for clarity,
  consistency, tone, accessibility, and localization readiness. Trigger

# SOTA UX Writing & Product Copy

## Purpose

Expert-level rules for the *words inside the product*: labels, buttons, errors,
empty states, onboarding, notifications, and every other string a user reads
while trying to get something done. The core thesis: **interface text is
functional infrastructure, not decoration — a user reads it under task
pressure, often in a second language, often through a screen reader, and every
word either moves them forward or costs them a support ticket.**

Boundaries: this skill owns the *language*. The UX *patterns* the language
lives in (when to show an empty state, validation timing, dialog escalation)
are `sota-frontend-design` rules/04; technical documentation is
`sota-docs-workflow`; outward-facing marketing content is `sota-copywriting`;
CLI-specific output contracts are `sota-cli-ux`.

## BUILD mode

When writing or changing interface text:

1. **Write the unhappy paths first** — errors, empty states, and confirmations
   carry more consequence than the happy path (`rules/03`).
2. **Apply the plain-language spine** to every string: relevant, findable,
   understandable, actionable (ISO 24495-1) — front-load the point, one idea
   per sentence, common words (`rules/01`).
3. **Name things once.** Check the product glossary before introducing a term;
   never let the UI, docs, and API call the same concept different names
   (`rules/01` §4).
4. **Buttons are verbs with objects** ("Delete project", never "OK"/"Yes"),
   and every dialog states the specific consequence (`rules/02`).
5. **Write for the translator and the screen reader as you go**: externalized
   strings, ICU plurals, named placeholders, descriptive link text, accessible
   names matching visible labels (`rules/04`).
6. Before finishing, run each loaded rules file's **Audit checklist** against
   the diff — including the greps for banned strings.

## AUDIT mode

When reviewing existing product copy:

1. Inventory the string surface: localization files (`*.json`, `*.po`,
   `*.strings`, `*.xlf`), hardcoded literals in components, error-message
   constants, email/notification templates.
2. Run the banned-pattern greps from each rules file's audit checklist
   (e.g. `"click here"`, `"an error occurred"`, `"invalid input"`,
   concatenated plurals).
3. Walk the critical flows as a user: signup, first-run empty state, a failed
   payment/submit, a destructive action. Judge every string against
   `rules/01`–`03`.
4. Check localization readiness (`rules/04`) even for single-language
   products — retrofitting string externalization is expensive.

### Severity conventions

- **Critical** — copy that causes data loss or deception: destructive-action
  dialog whose buttons don't name the action; error message leaking secrets,
  internals, or account existence; consent text that misrepresents what
  happens; dark-pattern confirmshaming.
- **High** — copy that blocks task completion or excludes users: error with no
  next step; placeholder used as the only label; icon-only control with no
  accessible name; untranslatable concatenated strings; link text meaningless
  out of context ("click here").
- **Medium** — friction and inconsistency: same concept under two names;
  jargon or internal codenames in UI; blame-framed errors; toasts carrying the
  only path to an action; missing empty-state guidance.
- **Low** — polish: tone drift, capitalization inconsistency, "please"
  inflation, exclamation marks, filler words ("simply", "just").

### Finding format

`file:line | rule violated | severity | effort | fix` — quote the current
string and propose the exact replacement string; copy findings without a
proposed rewrite are half-findings.

## Rules index

| File | Read this when... |
|---|---|
| `rules/01-voice-tone-plain-language.md` | Establishing or auditing the overall language system: voice vs tone, stress-aware tone shifts, plain-language rules (ISO 24495-1), readability, terminology/glossary discipline, capitalization and punctuation conventions. |
| `rules/02-microcopy-components.md` | Writing the words in components: buttons/CTAs, labels vs placeholders vs hints, empty states, onboarding and tooltips, confirmation dialogs, notifications/toasts/badges, counts and plurals, relative time, link text, loading/progress text. |
| `rules/03-errors-feedback.md` | Anything that reports a problem or outcome: error-message anatomy, no-blame framing, validation wording, security-sensitive errors, warnings vs errors, success confirmations, permission prompts, and dark-pattern-free upsell moments. |
| `rules/04-accessibility-localization.md` | Making the language reach everyone: WCAG 2.2 language criteria, alt text craft, accessible names, screen-reader-facing strings, string externalization, ICU plurals, translator context, text expansion, RTL, inclusive language. |

## Top-10 non-negotiables

1. **Every error says what happened and what to do next** — a dead-end error
   is a support ticket with extra steps. (rules/03 §1)
2. **Buttons and dialog actions are verb+object** ("Delete project",
   "Keep editing") — never bare "OK/Yes/No" pairs on anything consequential.
   (rules/02 §1, §5)
3. **The system takes the blame**: "We couldn't save your changes", never
   "You entered invalid data". (rules/03 §2)
4. **One concept, one name**, everywhere — UI, docs, API, support. Maintain a
   glossary; renames are migrations, not edits. (rules/01 §4)
5. **Placeholders are never labels**; hint text never disappears while the
   user still needs it. (rules/02 §2)
6. **No copy relies on color, position, or an icon alone** to carry meaning;
   every control has an accessible name matching its visible label.
   (rules/04 §2)
7. **Link and button text stands alone**: "View invoice #1042", never
   "click here" or a bare "Learn more". (rules/02 §8)
8. **No string concatenation, ever** — ICU MessageFormat with named
   placeholders and real plural rules; "1 items" ships nowhere. (rules/04 §4)
9. **Front-load every string**: the first three words carry the point;
   scanning users read little else. (rules/01 §2)
10. **Security-sensitive copy never leaks**: auth errors don't confirm account
    existence, error surfaces never show stack traces, internals, or secrets
    — cross-check `sota-code-security` rules/02 and /07. (rules/03 §4)
